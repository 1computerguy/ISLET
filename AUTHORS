Notes:

Want to join the team? Submit enough great patches over a long time,
implement what's available in the Github issues and show an ongoing,
active interest in supporting ISLET. What's in it for you? Being involved
in a useful project that helps things like hacker conferences and user group
events, plus I'll buy you a beer, meal, or something.
