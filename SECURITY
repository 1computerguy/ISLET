## Security Recommendations

The list below is for manually configuring the items and documenting recommendations.
Most of these are satisified by make targets.

* SSH: _/etc/ssh/sshd_config_

The following command will configure sshd_config to match the example after with the exception of modifying LoginGraceTime.

```shell
make security-config
```

```shell
LoginGraceTime 30s
ClientAliveInterval 15
ClientAliveCountMax 10

#Subsystem       sftp    /usr/libexec/openssh/sftp-server

Match User training
	ForceCommand /opt/islet/bin/islet_shell
	X11Forwarding no
	AllowTcpForwarding no
	PermitTunnel no
	PermitOpen none
	MaxAuthTries 3
	MaxSessions 1
	AllowAgentForwarding no
	PermitEmptyPasswords no
```

* Drop capabilities in containers:
ISLET inclues security.conf which can be used to easily add or drop kernel capabilities(7)
for containers. They can be set in any ISLET configuration file. Only add what you need
to run the software in the container.

* ulimit contraints

The following command will configure decent ulimit settings for docker processes.
These have the effect of restricting the user's environment inside the container.

```shell
make security-config
```

Adjust as necessary: _/etc/init/docker.conf_
```
# BEGIN ISLET Additions
limit nofile 1000 2000		 # Limit number of open files
limit nproc  1000 2000		 # Prevent fork bombs
limit fsize  100000000 200000000 # Limit file sizes to max of 200MB
# END
```

* Separate storage for containers:

```
service docker stop
rm -rf /var/lib/docker/*
mkfs.ext2 /dev/sdb1
mount -o defaults,noatime,nodiratime /dev/sdb1 /var/lib/docker
tail -1 /etc/fstab
	/dev/sdb1	/var/lib/docker	    ext2     defaults,noatime,nodiratime,nobootwait 0 1
service docker start
```

* Limit container storage size to prevent DoS or resource abuse

Switching storage backends to devicemapper allows for disk quotas.
Set dm.basesize to the maximum size the container can grow to (def: 10G)

**Note:** Currently unstable, and all existing container and image data will be lost.

Automatic:

```
make docker-config SIZE=3G
```

Manual:

```
service docker stop
rm -rf /var/lib/docker/*
docker -d --storage-driver=devicemapper --storage-opt dm.basesize=3G &
sleep 3 && pkill docker
tail -1 /etc/default/docker
	DOCKER_OPTS="--storage-driver=devicemapper --storage-opt dm.basesize=3G"
start docker
```

**Note:** There's currently a bug in devicemapper that may cause docker to fail run containers [more info](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/4036).

* Iptables

Rate limiting protection for the SSH service
```
make iptables-config
```

* GRSecurity kernel patches

To aid in protecting the host system it's recommended to patch the Linux kernel [more info](https://grsecurity.net/)
